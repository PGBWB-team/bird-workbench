BirdNET_run-file_combinerV3.sh

Combines the Birdnet-Analyzer selection.table.txt files in a directory
into a single combined file of results.  

This script performs the same function as the --combine_results option 
in the CLI BirdNET-Analyzer but it combines the results of a directory 
rather than the results of a BirdNET-Analyzer run. 

Run as part of the Update Archive workflow (see more in the GitHUB wiki)
