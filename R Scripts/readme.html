# This script:
# 
# Is downstream from the BirdNET_run_file_combiner_prod.sh BASH script,
# Reads a single-year text file of BirdNET IDs, 
# Cleans up the data, 
# Uses fuzzy logic to join each row with averages calculated from SQL-based local weather 
#    observations, 
# Creates a single-year FST file, and 
# Combines it with other such files to create an all-years FST that's used as input by 
#    the UI script.
