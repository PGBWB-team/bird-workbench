Our R UI code is generating public URLs for each page that is displayed.  Caddy is used in conjunction with DNS 
to make those URLs visible.

Caddy is used as a reverse proxy to map pgbwb.com and birdomatic.com URLs to running services inside our network.  
Much more about this at https://caddyserver.com/.  Chatbots ala ChatGPT are a great help explanining what's going 
on and getting it set up.

We use DNS to point pgbwb.com and birdomatic.com URLs to our external network address.  Caddy maps what IP address and port those requests should be 
routed to based on the incoming URL.  

For example: 
   prod.pgbwb.com might go to IP 192.168.1.222 port 8888 
   test.pgwbw.com might go to IP 192.168.1.223 port 8899
   tiny.pgbwb.com might go to IP 192.168.1.224 port 8877

We use our local rounter to point those URLs at the internal LAN IP address of our server to make that work 
*inside* the network.  In our case we're using the Host Mapping function to get the traffice to the right 
internal address.  Once again, Caddy uses the incoming URL to determine which port that traffic should use.

The caddyfile is where those mapping rules are maintained.
