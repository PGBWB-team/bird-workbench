our R UI code is generating public URLs for each page that is displayed.  Caddy is used in conjunction with DNS to make those URLs visible.

Caddy is used as a reverse proxy to map pgbwb.com and birdomatic.com URLs to running services inside our network.  Much more about this at https://caddyserver.com/.  Chatbots ala ChatGPT are a great help explanining what's going on and getting it set up.

We use DNS to point pgbwb URLs to our network.  Caddy maps what IP address and port those requests should be routed to once they get here.  
For example: 
   prod.pgbwb.com might go to IP 192.168.1.222 port 8888 
   test.pgwbw.com might go to IP 192.168.1.222 port 8899
   tiny.pgbwb.com might go to IP 192.168.1.222 port 8877

We use our local rounter to point those URLs at the internal LAN IP address of our server to make that work *inside* the network.  Caddy uses the URL to determine which port that traffic should use.

The caddyfile is where those mapping rules are maintained.
