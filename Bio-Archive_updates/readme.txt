This script:

Reads a single-year text file of BirdNET IDs, 
Cleans up the data, 
Uses fuzzy logic to join each row with averages calculated from SQL-based local weather observations, 
Creates a single-year FST file, and 
Combines it with other such files to create an all-years FST that's used as input by the UI script.
