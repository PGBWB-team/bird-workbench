# Pretty Good Bird Workbench
Hi! Welcome to the repository for the 'Pretty Good Bird Workbench'. I worked on this project with Mike from Prairie Haven 
to review results from Cornell Lab of Ornithology's BirdNET Analyzer. Pretty Good Bird Workbench is a Shiny-backed web 
application that organizes years of bioacoustic data into various forms. This application can be used to look at BirdNET 
observations for specific species over time and across different habitats. This tool also allows you to drilldown into
specific species and manually review the recorded observations to confirm or deny species presence. Pretty Good Bird Workbench
contains interactive plots and dataframes for further exploration, and can play short audio clips and generate spectrograms
for specific BirdNET observations. Each of the tools within Pretty Good Bird Workbench are explained in the Wiki (still to come).
